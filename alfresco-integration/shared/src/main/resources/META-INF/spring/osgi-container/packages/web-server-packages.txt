# Classes from these Java packages are loaded by the web server classloader.
# They must be specified explicitly, because the implementation currently
# only scans for Java packages in the web application.
#
# In a standard Tomcat directory layout these classes can typically be 
# found in the 'endorsed', 'lib' and 'shared' folders.
#
# To expand on this list, place custom package configuration at this classpath
# location: /dynamic-extensions/configuration/web-server-packages.txt
#
# For a standard Alfresco directly layout this corresponds to:
# <alfresco>/tomcat/shared/classes/dynamic-extensions/configuration/web-server-packages.txt
